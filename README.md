# Satel's Docker Python base

## :compass: Purpose

This docker image is a base for Satel webapp's python backend.
The standard packages we use in most projects are already installed.
The folder structure and commands provide the standard framework for development
and deployment to production of the app.

## :building_construction: Developing 

There is a `dev.sh` script included that builds both docker images and runs
one of 3 cases based on the parameter you pass in:
1. `./dev.sh validate` runs the validation scripts (validatecodeonce)
2. `./dev.sh run` runs the main application.
3. `./dev.sh cli` drops you into the cli for the image

## :hourglass_flowing_sand: Migration to version > 202205

Starting with the version 202207, the docker python base does not contain
any preinstalled python packages. It is now just providing a folder structure
with adequate permissions for the python user, and a standard test suite.

As a consequence upgrading to version 202207 and latest requires to
add the packages that used to be provided by the docker python base image.
The list of packages in listed in the
[removed-packages.txt](./removed-packages.txt) file.

The docker python base test image uses now poetry as it is the preferred
way to manage dependencies at Satel. It can be used as an example
on how to use poetry while building a python app image.

## :open_file_folder: Folder structure

The `/python` folder is the base folder for all the files of this images
such as the `entrypoint.sh`. Then the subfolders organize the app files:

* `/python/app` holds the source of the app
* `/python/static` holds the static files served by the app such as static html files
* `/python/logs` is meant for the log files generated by the app
* `/python/files` is for files uploaded through the app

## :toolbox: Notes for maintenance

### Upgrade python base image versions

1. Go to docker hub to get the latest patch version for
    the [python docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/)
2. Then 2 files need to be edited with the latest python minor or patch versions:
    1. `.github/workflows/docker_image.yml` to build and push the right images to docker hub.
    1. `Dockerfile` to change the default base image version. This is used only for testing
       while developing but better to keep it up to date.

## :keyboard: Commands

The entrypoint of this docker image provides standard commands for our app's docker
image to call with `CMD` in the Dockerfile.
These commands are effectively run as arguments of the entrypoint such as:

```bash
/python/entrypoint.sh startapp
```

The `.bashrc` file contains aliases so that one can also just call `startapp`
from within the docker container.

**NOTE**: If you want to run a bash command, just pass it to the docker container
and it will be executed since it doesn't match one of the predefined commands.
Example here running the `ls` command:

```bash
docker run satel/python-base:latest ls
```

### `startapp`

Run the app in production mode. *This is the default `CMD` is none is provided*.
The app is expected to be a FastAPI `app` defined in `/python/app/webapp/main.py`
such that the app is executed with the command:
```bash
uvicorn --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 webapp.main:app
```
You can replace `webapp.main:app` by setting the first argument of the `startapp`
command such that for example:
```bash
startapp myapp:theapp
```

The command will try to load the `config.sh` from multiple locations:

1. From the docker secrets folder
2. From the current directory, being `/python/app`
3. If the previous locations don't have a `config.sh` file, the `config.sh.example`
   file is loaded from the current directory if it exists as a fallback. This is
   useful for CI/CD environments for which the example values are good enough to
   run the tests

### `developapp`

Run the app in development mode with `watchmedo` from the `watchdog` python package
such that the app restarts whenever the code changes in `/python/app`.
The same default location (`webapp.main:app`) and option to change the location
as `startapp` are used for `developapp`.

The configuration file is loaded the same way as in `startapp`.

### `validatecode`

This command is used during development to automatically run the `pytest` tests,
the `mypy` typing check and the `flake8` linting check whenever the code changes.

The `flake8` linting includes `isort` import module sorting thanks to the `flake8-isort`
plugin.

This code validation command executes the `/python/test_suite.sh` script which can
be overwritten with custom code validation.

### `validatecodeonce`

Same as `validatecode` but executed once rather than continously running on
code change.
This can be used for CI/CD purposes since it generates report files in the `/python/reports`
folder.

### `runtests` (DEPRECATED)

**DEPRECATED**: Use `validatecodeonce` instead

This command runs only the `pytest` tests for CI/CD purposes. It outputs the tests
and code coverage results in the `/python/app/unittesting.xml` and
`/python/app/coverage.xml` files respectively.

A [coverage configuration file](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html)
can be provided at `python/app/coverage.conf`.
