# Satel's Docker Python base

## Purpose

This docker image is a base for Satel webapp's python backend.
The standard packages we use in most projects are already installed.
The folder structure and commands provide the standard framework for development
and deployment to production of the app.

## Folder structure

The `/python` folder is the base folder for all the files of this images
such as the `entrypoint.sh`. Then the subfolders organize the app files:

* `/python/app` holds the source of the app
* `/python/static` holds the static files served by the app such as static html files
* `/python/logs` is meant for the log files generated by the app
* `/python/files` is for files uploaded through the app

## Commands

The entrypoint of this docker image provides standard commands for our app's docker
image to call with `CMD` in the Dockerfile.
These commands are effectively run as arguments of the entrypoint such as:

```bash
/python/entrypoint.sh startapp
```

The `.bashrc` file contains aliases so that one can also just call `startapp`
from within the docker container.

### startapp

Run the app in production mode.
The app is expected to be a FastAPI `app` defined in `/python/app/webapp/main.py`
such that the app is executed with the command:
```bash
uvicorn --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 webapp.main:app
```
You can replace `webapp.main:app` by setting the first argument of the `startapp`
command such that for example:
```bash
startapp myapp:theapp
```

The command will try to load the `config.sh` from multiple locations:

1. From the docker secrets folder
2. From the current directory, being `/python/app`
3. If the previous locations don't have a `config.sh` file, the `config.sh.example`
   file is loaded from the current directory if it exists as a fallback. This is
   useful for CI/CD environments for which the example values are good enough to
   run the tests

### developapp

Run the app in development mode with `watchmedo` from the `watchdog` python package
such that the app restarts whenever the code changes in `/python/app`.
The same default location (`webapp.main:app`) and option to change the location
as `startapp` are used for `developapp`.

The configuration file is loaded the same way as in `startapp`.

### validatecode

This command is used during development to automatically run the `pytest` tests,
the `mypy` typing check and the `flake8` linting check whenever the code changes.

The `flake8` linting includes `isort` import module sorting thanks to the `flake8-isort`
plugin.

This code validation command executes the `/python/test_suite.sh` script which can
be overwritten with custom code validation.

### runtests

This command runs only the `pytest` tests for CI/CD purposes. It outputs the tests
and code coverage results in the `/python/app/unittesting.xml` and
`/python/app/coverage.xml` files respectively.

A [coverage configuration file](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html)
can be provided at `python/app/coverage.conf`.
